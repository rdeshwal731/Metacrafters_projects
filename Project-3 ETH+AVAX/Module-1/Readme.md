# Error Handling- require, assert, revert

This Solidity program demonstrates the Error Handling statements "require()", "assert()" and "revert()" in Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to implement a basic smart contract with require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three functions that returns implementation of error handling statements. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code(from Errorhandling.sol file) into the file:



To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Errorhandling.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Errorhandlingcontract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by using various options that show up in the Deployed Contracts>>ERRORHANDLINGCONTRACT.
