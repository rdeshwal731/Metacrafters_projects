## Description:

</br>1. The code provides a basic implementation of a token contract with minting and burning functionality. 

</br>2. It allows for the creation and destruction of tokens while keeping track of balances for differentÂ addresses.

</br>3. Use Remix IDE for compiling this code.


## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code(from CreateToken.sol file) into the file:



To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile CreateToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "CreateTokencontract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by using various options that show up in the Deployed Contracts>>CREATETOKENCONTRACT.
